This is the Digital Story Creator. It takes images and uses them like cards.
It organizes them by folder and prefix (the characters before nn.ext, when nn
is up to a 6-digit number and ext is an image file extension). It will accept
png, jpg, bmp, and gif files for now. It will present a board to the user and 
allow them to select what pools they want to draw from, where to place them,
and how to orient them. It will also allow the user to save screen shots of
the board.

This product is generic and will not include graphics from any sources. The
idea is to allow the user to use their own images or digital decks they have
purchased from other creators.

This program is governed under the general license in ./etc.
